# Learn from c

Concepts: variables, data structures, functions, loops, and pointers

application structure:
## main argc argv
## debug tools; scanf, printf;

a stream is a sequence of bytes transferred in one direction from its source to its target.

# Standard output stream; table; 
printf() stdout screen; fprintf() file; sprintf() memory stream;
int printf(const char* format, ...);
int fprintf(FILE* stream, const char* format, ...);

# Standard input stream
scanf() from console;

# formatted input & output

# Working with Files;persistent storage mechanism;
save our data -> exit the program -> use it later;
